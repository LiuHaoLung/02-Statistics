    "### Mean\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean also know as the sample average, it is denoted by the <code>μ</code> for a population and the <code>x̄</code> for the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can by adding up all the components and then dividing by the number of components.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean is the most common measure of central tendency but it is has a huge downside, it is easily effected by outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "New York City     |Los Angeles\n",
    "---               |---\n",
    "1                 |1\n",
    "2                 |2\n",
    "3                 |3\n",
    "3                 |4\n",
    "5                 |5\n",
    "6                 |6\n",
    "7                 |7\n",
    "8                 |8\n",
    "9                 |9\n",
    "11                |10\n",
    "66                |-\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean table is below:\n",
    "\n",
    "New York City     |Los Angeles\n",
    "---               |---\n",
    "11                |5.5\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the mean will effected by outliers(like the 66), so the mean is not enough to make definite conclusions.\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "### Median\n",
    "\n",
    "The median is basically the middle number in an ordered dataset, in order to calculate the median we have to order our data in ascending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the example is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Position     |New York City     |Los Angeles\n",
    "---          |---               |---\n",

    "2            |2                 |2\n",
    "3            |3                 |3\n",
    "3            |4                 |4\n",
    "5            |5                 |5\n",
    "6            |6                 |6\n",
    "7            |7                 |7\n",
    "8            |8                 |8\n",
    "9            |9                 |9\n",
    "10           |11                |10\n",
    "11           |66                |-\n",
    "\n",
    "The median of the dataset if the number at position and plus 1 divided by 2, that means <code>(n+1)/2</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean and median table is below:\n",
    "\n",
    "Type         |New York City     |Los Angeles\n",
    "---          |---               |---\n",
    "Mean         |11                |5.5\n",
    "Median       |6                 |5.5\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the mean, the median is not affected by the outliers.\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "The mode is the value that occurs most often, it can be used for both numerical and categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean, median and mode table is below:\n",
    "\n",
    "Type         |New York City     |Los Angeles\n",
    "---          |---               |---\n",
    "Mean         |11                |5.5\n",
    "Median       |6                 |5.5\n",
    "Mode         |3                 |-\n",
    "\n",
    "The Los Angeles each price appears only once, so there is no mode or we can say there are 10 modes, but it will be meaningless with 10 oberservations and an experienced statistician would never do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general you often hava multiple modes usually two or three modes are tolerable, but more than that would be defeat the purpose of finding a mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "The measures of central tendency should be used together rather than independently, therefore there is no best, but using only one is definitely the worst."
