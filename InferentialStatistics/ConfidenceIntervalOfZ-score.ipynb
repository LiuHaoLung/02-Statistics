    "A confidence interval is the range within you expect the population parameter to be and it is estimation is based on the data we have in our sample.\n",

    "There can be two main situations when we calculate the confidence intervals for a population when the population variance is known and when it is unknown, depending on which situation we are in we would use a different calculation method.\n",
    "\n",
    "When explore the confidence intervals for a population with known variance and important assumption in this calculation is that the population is normally distribution, even if it not, you should use a large sample and let the CLT do the normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common confidence level is 90%, 95%, 99%, so the <code>α</code> is 10%, 5%, 1%.\n",

    "A 95% confidence interval means that you are sure that in 95% of the cases, the true population parameter would fall into the specified interva.\n",

    "\n",
    "So the formula for the confidence interval with a known variance is given below <code>[x̄ - (Zα/2 * σ / n^0.5),x̄ + (Zα/2 * σ / n^0.5)].</code>\n",

    "<code>x̄</code> means the sample means and it is the point estimate, <code>σ / n^0.5</code> means the standard error.\n",
