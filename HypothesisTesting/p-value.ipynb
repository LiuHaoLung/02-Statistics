    "We can check z table for 4.67 which gives us the same result as -4.67, but in most tables you would not even find this value as it is so large, thus we round up to the closet value available and get 0.0001, the p-value = <code>1 - 0.9990(number from table) = 0.0001.</code>\n",

    "Most statistical software calculates p-value for each test and then provide us with a series results, it is then up two the research to decide whether the variable is statistically significant or not, generally software is designed to calculate the value to the third digit after the separator, the closer to 0 your p-value is the most significant is the result you've obtained and the p-value is an extremely powerful measure as it works for all distributions."
